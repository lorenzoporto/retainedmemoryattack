# Memory Security Testing Lab - Flutter

## Overview
A lab environment for testing memory vulnerabilities in Flutter applications. Focuses on memory retention analysis and data leak detection through JIT and AOT compilation modes.

## Features
- Memory dump analysis
- JIT cache monitoring
- Heap inspection
- String table analysis
- Memory leak detection
- AOT memory analysis
- Frida integration
- DevTools memory analysis

## Security Testing Tools
- Memory Protection module
- Secure Book implementation
- Heap analyzer
- Memory retention tests
- Frida scripts for Flutter memory tracing
- Flutter DevTools monitoring

## Use Cases
- Bug bounty research
- Memory leak detection
- Sensitive data exposure analysis
- Retained memory inspection
- Memory mapping vulnerability assessment
- Object retention analysis via DevTools

## Important Notice
This lab uses JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation mode for studying Dart VM behavior. For production testing, always use AOT (Ahead-Of-Time) mode with proper safeguards and obfuscation enabled. JIT testing provides insights into VM operations but does not reflect real-world deployment security.

## Memory Analysis Methods
- DevTools memory profiling and heap dumps
- Object allocation tracking
- Memory timeline analysis
- Retained memory inspection
- Memory fragmentation detection

## Security Notice
This lab is for educational purposes and responsible security research only. Report vulnerabilities through appropriate disclosure channels.

## Development Environment
- Flutter SDK
- Frida tools
- Memory analysis utilities
- Debug tools configured for JIT mode
- Flutter DevTools configured for memory profiling

## Research Focus
- Understanding Dart VM memory management
- Analyzing memory retention patterns
- Identifying potential data leaks
- Testing memory protection mechanisms
- Object lifetime analysis via DevTools
- Memory snapshot inspection
